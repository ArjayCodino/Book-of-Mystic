                     <h2>Preparing for the Reading</h2>
                    <p>Before we dive into the actual reading process, here are a few essential steps to ensure you get the most out of your tarot experience:</p>
                    <br>
                    <b>Choose a quiet, comfortable space:</b> Tarot readings are best done in a calm environment free from distractions. Find a spot where you can sit comfortably and focus on your cards. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Clear your mind:</b> Take a few deep breaths, close your eyes, and allow any thoughts or worries to float away. The more centered and relaxed you are, the clearer your intuition will be. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Set your intention:</b> Before drawing your cards, take a moment to think about the question or situation you’d like to explore. Be as specific as possible, and remember that tarot is a tool for guidance, not a crystal ball. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Shuffle your deck:</b> Give your cards a good shuffle, ensuring that they are well mixed. While shuffling, continue to focus on your intention and visualize the energy flowing through the cards. <br>

                 <h2>Performing the Past-Present-Future Spread</h2>
               <p>Once you’ve prepared yourself and your deck, it’s time to lay out your cards. Here’s a step-by-step guide to performing the Past-Present-Future spread:</p>
               <br>
               <b>Draw three cards:</b> With your intention in mind, draw the top three cards from your shuffled deck. Don’t overthink this process; trust your intuition to guide you. <br>
               <br>
               <b>Lay out the cards:</b> Place the cards face-down in front of you, from left to right. The first card represents the past, the second the present, and the third the future. <br>
               <b>Turn over the first card:</b> Reveal the past card, which represents past events, emotions, or energies that have influenced your present situation. Take a moment to observe the imagery, symbols, and colors on the card, and consider how they relate to your question or intention. <br>
               <br>
               <b>Turn over the second card:</b>  Next, reveal the present card. This card offers insight into your current situation, including any challenges, opportunities, or energies that are at play. Reflect on how this card connects to the past card, and what lessons or guidance it may offer. <br>
               <br>
               <b>Turn over the third card:</b> Finally, reveal the future card, which represents potential outcomes or influences in the future. While the future is never set in stone, this card provides a glimpse into the possible paths that lie ahead, based on your present situation and past experiences. <br>
               <br>
               <b >Reflect on the reading:</b> Take some time to contemplate the story that unfolds across the three cards, and how the messages relate to your question or intention. Remember, tarot is a powerful tool for self-discovery and growth, so consider how the insights from this reading can help you make empowered decisions and embrace the opportunities that come your way.
